I am currently enrolled as a PhD student for ElectricitÃ© de France & INRIA Sophia-Antipolis ðŸ“š

My subject is *Federated Learning for Time Series, applied to the energy demain*

<sub>The aim is to develop robust methods to learn on decentralized and non-stationarity data, taking into account local specificities (a.ka. enable personalization). Applications include local time series forecasting (e.g. electricity load), imputation, anomaly detection, etc ðŸ’»</sub><br>


I am also a science and video / photography enthusiast ðŸŽ¥ (see links to my projects)
