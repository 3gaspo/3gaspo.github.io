I am currently enrolled as a PhD student for Electricité de France & INRIA Sophia-Antipolis  :books:

My subject is *Federated Learning for Time Series*, applied to the energy demain.

The aim is to develop robust methods to learn on decentralized and non-stationarity data, taking into account local specificities (a.ka. enable personalization). Applications include local time series forecasting (e.g. electricity load), imputation, anomaly detection, etc.

I am also a science and video / photography enthusiast (see links to my projects)
