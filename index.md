I am currently enrolled as a PhD student for [ElectricitÃ© de France](https://www.edf.fr/groupe-edf/inventer-l-avenir-de-l-energie/r-d-un-savoir-faire-mondial) & [INRIA Sophia-Antipolis](https://team.inria.fr/neo/presentation/#:~:text=NEO%20is%20a%20team%20of%20Inria%E2%80%99s%20research%20center,in%20January%202017%20and%20follows%20Inria%E2%80%99s%20project-team%20MAESTRO.) ðŸ“š

My subject is *Federated Learning for Time Series, applied to the energy demain*.

<sub>The aim is to develop robust methods to learn on decentralized and non-stationary data, taking into account local specificities (enabling personalization). Applications include local time series forecasting (e.g. electricity load), imputation, anomaly detection, etc ðŸ’»</sub><br>


I am also a science, video \& photography enthusiast ðŸŽ¥ (see links to my projects).
